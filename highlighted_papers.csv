Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation with Multifingered Hands Via Visuomotor Diffusion,"We present a framework for learning dexterous in-hand manipulation with multifingered hands using visuomotor diffusion policies. Our system enables complex in-hand manipulation tasks, such as unscrewing a bottle lid with one hand, by leveraging a fast and responsive teleoperation setup for the four-fingered Allegro Hand. We collect high-quality expert demonstrations using an augmented reality (AR) interface that tracks hand movements and applies inverse kinematics and motion retargeting for precise control. The AR headset provides real-time visualization, while gesture controls streamline teleoperation. To enhance policy learning, we introduce a novel demonstration outlier removal approach based on HDBSCAN clustering and the Global-Local Outlier Score from Hierarchies (GLOSH) algorithm, effectively filtering out low-quality demonstrations that could degrade performance. We evaluate our approach extensively in real-world settings and provide all experimental videos on the project website: https://dex-manip.github.io/"
Wearable Roller Rings to Augment In-Hand Manipulation through Active Surfaces,"In-hand manipulation is a crucial ability for reorienting and repositioning objects within grasps. The main challenges in this are not only the complexity of the computational models, but also the risks of grasp instability caused by active finger motions, such as rolling, sliding, breaking, and remaking contacts. This paper presents the development of the Roller Ring (RR), a modular robotic attachment with active surfaces that is wearable by both robot and human hands to manipulate without lifting a finger. By installing the angled RRs on hands, such that their spatial motions are not colinear, we derive a general differential motion model for manipulating objects. Our motion model shows that complete in-hand manipulation skill sets can be provided by as few as only 2 RRs through non-holonomic object motions, while more RRs can enable enhanced manipulation dexterity with fewer motion constraints. Through extensive experiments, we test the RRs on both a robot hand and a human hand to evaluate their manipulation capabilities. We show that the RRs can be employed to manipulate arbitrary object shapes to provide dexterous in-hand manipulation."
Open-Loop Deep Reinforcement Learning Control of Soft Robotic In-Hand Manipulations,"In-hand manipulation tasks using hand-like robotic grippers offer a promising approach to accomplish various tasks in a human-centered environment. Due to the inherent safety of soft robots, in-hand manipulations performed by soft robots provide great opportunities for future human-robot collaboration, which is the scope of this paper. By modeling a new and innovative soft-robotic gripper known as the Anthropomorphic Soft Gripper and synthesis of an open-loop controller with deep reinforcement learning, it is demonstrated how the movement of objects by in-hand manipulations can be accomplished. Moreover, this work explores the application of deep reinforcement learning methods without the employment for domain randomization. As noted by Bhatt et al. the inherent soft properties of soft robotic grippers enable remarkably robust in-hand manipulation in open-loop control, giving the impetus for the approach that is being followed in this work. Motion sequences generated in simulation are successfully transferred to the real anthropomorphic soft gripper and validated in experiments."
Vibration-Induced Friction Modulation to Enable Controlled Sliding for In-Hand Manipulation,"Achieving controlled sliding of objects on finger surfaces is a significant challenge for robots, substantially constraining their ability to perform complex in-hand manipulation tasks. In this work, we investigate the role of surface vibration in modulating the effective friction at the object-finger contact locations to facilitate controlled sliding. We demonstrate that friction at contact points can be reduced by applying targeted vibrations at specific locations on a robotic finger, creating regions that are suitable for sliding. In this way, we create sticking/sliding regions on finger surfaces on demand and can easily switch between sliding and rolling contacts. To investigate this phenomenon, we embedded an array of vibration modules into robotic fingers. We first analyzed the velocity fields created by surface vibrations on a single finger. Then, we developed a method to select the appropriate activation states of the modules that achieve the desired velocity field at a given object location. Utilizing these fingers and the vibration selection method, we formed a two-finger robotic hand and demonstrated controlled sliding and rotation of a held object within the hand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes vibration-induced friction modulation for in-hand manipulation that can achieve combinations of object sliding and rolling actions."
An Inflatable Deployable Origami Grasper for Adaptive and High-Load Grasping,"Robotic graspers are essential for enhancing the efficiency and versatility of robots in grasping tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel inflatable deployable origami grasper with a rigid-flexible coupling structure. The proposed grasper can achieve multiple deployment configurations under a single pneumatic actuation, enabling both deployment and grasping operations while also allowing for passive self-folding during deflation. The design and fabrication of the grasper are presented. Then, the stiffness model for the inflatable deployable origami unit is developed based on the equivalent truss method. Experimental results show that the grasper successfully grasps objects of various shapes and sizes in both enveloping and fingertip grasping modes, using either two or four fingers. With its simple mechanical system and high deploy/fold ratio, the proposed grasper holds significant potential for applications in industrial automation and space exploration."
Haptic-ACT: Bridging Human Intuition with Compliant Robotic Manipulation Via Immersive VR,"Robotic manipulation is essential for the widespread adoption of robots in industrial and home settings and has long been a focus within the robotics community. Advances in artificial intelligence have introduced promising learning-based methods to address this challenge, with imitation learning emerging as particularly effective. However, efficiently acquiring high-quality demonstrations remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce an immersive VR-based teleoperation setup designed to collect demonstrations from a remote human user. We also propose an imitation learning framework called Haptic Action Chunking with Transformers (Haptic-ACT). To evaluate the platform, we conducted a pick-and-place task and collected 50 demonstration episodes. Results indicate that the immersive VR platform significantly reduces demonstrator fingertip forces compared to systems without haptic feedback, enabling more delicate manipulation. Additionally, evaluations of the Haptic-ACT framework in both the MuJoCo simulator and on a real robot demonstrate its effectiveness in teaching robots more compliant manipulation compared to the original ACT. Additional materials are available at https://sites.google.com/view/hapticact."
High DOF Tendon-Driven Soft Hand: A Modular System for Versatile and Dexterous Manipulation,"The soft robotic hand exhibits a wide range of manipulation capabilities, which are attributed to the dexterity of its soft fingers and their coordinated movements. Therefore, designing a versatile soft hand requires careful consideration of both the characteristics of the individual fingers, such as degree of freedom (DOF), and their strategic arrangements to optimize performance for specific target tasks. This work presents a modularized high DOF tendon-driven soft finger and a customized design of a soft robotic hand for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks. Furthermore, an all-in-one module is developed that integrates both the 4-way tendon-driven soft finger body and drive parts. Its high DOF enables multi-directional actuations with a wide actuation range, thereby expanding possible manipulation modes. The modularity of the system expands the design space for finger arrangements, which enables the diverse configuration of robotic hands and facilitates the customization of task-oriented platforms. To achieve sophisticated control of these complex configurations, we employ neural network-planned trajectories, enabling the precise execution of complicated tasks. The performance of a single finger is validated, including dexterity and payload, and several real-world manipulation tasks are demonstrated, including writing, grasping, rotating, and spreading, using motion primitives of diverse soft hands with distinctive finger arrangements. These demonstrations showcase the system's versatility and precision in various tasks. We expect that our system will contribute to the expansion of possibilities in the field of soft robotic manipulation."
Peg-In-Hole Assembly Method Based on Visual Reinforcement Learning and Tactile Pose Estimation,"When robots replicate human actions in peg-in-hole assembly tasks, such as USB Type-A insertion and removal, the complexity of the process and frequent obstructions from the inner walls make it difficult for robots to handle collisions or avoid jamming. These difficulties contribute to a low success rate in assembly.This paper proposes a vision-guided reinforcement learning pre-assembly combined with tactile feedback-based pose estimation adjustment method for peg-in-hole assembly, achieving significant improvement in success rates for complex assembly tasks. First, during the pretraining process of reinforcement learning, high-reward sample data is collected, and a behaviour cloning (BC) algorithm is constructed based on sample data structure. The network is pretrained as a policy regression layer. Under sparse reward conditions, outputs of the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) network and the BC network are combined to improve training stability and accelerate convergence, enhancing the efficiency of vision-based assembly. Then, to address the instability caused by collisions with the inner and outer walls of the hole when vision-based assembly remains incomplete, an in-hand pose estimation algorithm based on the Gelsight visuotactile sensor is integrated. This algorithm facilitates real-time adjustments to the position of the robotâ€™s end-effector, improving the likelihood of successful peg-in-hole assembly. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the V-REP simulation platform and the real Franka robot platform. In the experiments, success rates of 90-93% and 80-85%, respectively, were achieved."
PneuChip: A Compact Pneumatic Controller for Large-Scale Soft Artificial Muscles,"Pneumatic soft actuators are known for their versatility and reliability; however, their control presents a major challenge as systems scale beyond tens of actuators. Traditional rigid pneumatic valves add bulk, weight, and complexity, while most soft valves fail to generate programmable independent output states. We propose PneuChip, a compact pneumatic controller designed for large-scale soft actuators. The PneuChip functions as a two-dimensional array with m rows and n columns, controlled by m+n input signals to generate 2^(m+n)-2^m-2^n+2 distinct output states, enabling programmable control over mÃ—n soft actuators. To validate its effectiveness, we implemented PneuChip in a muscular-skeletal robotic arm comprising 24 Miura-Ori inspired, negative pressure-actuated artificial muscles and a rigid two-link skeleton connected by a ball joint. A 4Ã—6 PneuChip was fabricated and integrated to control the armâ€™s 3 degree of freedoms (DOFs) motion. Within a 120Â° rotation range, the robot arm achieved 946 distinct positions with smooth state transitions, paving the way for future applications in trajectory tracking and dexterous manipulation. The compact design and high controllability of PneuChip promise to notably simplify complex pneumatic systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of large-scale soft robots for various applications."
A Bio-Inspired Stiffness-Programmable Robotic Flexible Joint Based on Electro-Adhesive Clutches,"Robots with active variable stiffness (VS) capabilities can potentially achieve safer interactions with humans and better adaptabilities to uncertainties in complex environments. Currently, the conventional jamming or phase-change-based VS mechanisms simultaneously act on the stiffnesses of the robotic joint in all axes, making it difficult to achieve decoupled stiffness programming in different directions/axes. To overcome this challenge, a bio-inspired stiffness-programmable robotic flexible joint (SPRFJ) based on the electro-adhesive (EA) clutches is proposed. By programming the ON/OFF states of the EA clutches on different surfaces around the SPRFJ, customization of stiffness profiles in different directions/axes can be realized, and therefore, the load-bearing capacity and flexibility of the robotic arm can be adjusted. A SPRFJ prototype consisting of four EA clutch units is developed, and through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that it can achieve a stiffness change of 21 times and can withstand resisting forces up to 13.41 N at 1 kV. The reliable multi-directional stiffness programmability of the SPRFJ is shown via extensive tests. Demonstrations on stable position locking at different angles and free movements while carrying payloads are conducted to showcase its application in soft robotics. This SPRFJ developed in this work processes the potential in industrial robots, search-and-rescue missions, and space explorations."
Modeling of Viscoelastic Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators,"Soft robots and smart materials have seen rapid advancements in recent years, with significant potential applications in medical devices. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are particularly known for their large deformations and diverse actuation modes, which can serve as the end effector in soft catheters. However, LCEs exhibit strong hysteresis, which make their modeling and control challenging. In this paper, we develop a dynamic model of a light-stimulated LCE to describe its nonlinear time-dependent behavior. We first derive the relationship between the input laser power and the resulting temperature change, and then analyze the viscoelastic behavior of the LCE by taking advantage of a spring-dashpot frame. For both the linear contraction actuator and the bending actuator, the dynamic equations can describe their behavior with acceptable errors. The model is well-suited for LCE actuators with complex structures and provides a foundation for future control."
A Crab-Inspired Soft Gripper with Single-Finger Dexterous Grasping Capabilities,"Soft grippers conform to the shape and surface properties of the objects to be grasped, effectively avoiding damage to soft and fragile items. Despite the variety of existing soft gripper designs, their structures lack sufficient flexibility for effectively grasping slender objects or operating in narrow spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a soft gripper with single-finger grasping capabilities, inspired by the structure of crab claws. The structural design and the fabrication method of the gripper are introduced, and the analytical bending model is derived. Experiments are conducted under typical operating conditions to validate the model, and the results indicate that the measured data are in good accordance with the predicted responses. Furthermore, a series of grasping experiments are carried out to test the single-finger grasping capabilities of the proposed soft gripper. The results indicate that the proposed soft gripper can efficiently and stably grasp slender or irregular objects with a single finger. In particular, it demonstrates suitability for operations in narrow spaces and shows potential for handling complex tasks. This innovative design effectively reduces the complexity of the system, while exhibiting promising capabilities in grasping slender or irregular objects and operating within restricted spaces."
A Novel Gripper with Semi-Peaucellier Linkage and Idle-Stroke Mechanism for Linear Pinching and Self-Adaptive Grasping,"This paper introduces a novel robotic gripper, named as the SPD gripper. It features a palm and two mechanically identical and symmetrically arranged fingers, which can be driven independently or by a single motor. The fingertips of the fingers follow a linear motion trajectory, facilitating the grasping of objects of various sizes on a tabletop without the need to adjust the overall height of the gripper. Traditional industrial grippers with parallel gripping capabilities often exhibit an arcuate motion at the fingertips, requiring the entire robotic arm to adjust its height to avoid collisions with the tabletop. The SPD gripper, with its linear parallel gripping mechanism, effectively addresses this issue. Furthermore, the SPD gripper possesses adaptive capabilities, accommodating objects of different shapes and sizes. This paper presents the design philosophy, fundamental composition principles, and optimization analysis theory of the SPD gripper. Based on the design theory, a robotic gripper prototype was developed and tested. The experimental results demonstrate that the robotic gripper successfully achieves linear parallel gripping functionality and exhibits good adaptability. In the context of the ongoing development of embodied intelligence technologies, this robotic gripper can assist various robots in achieving effective grasping, laying a solid foundation for collecting data to enhance deep learning training."
VTAO-BiManip: Masked Visual-Tactile-Action Pre-Training with Object Understanding for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation,"Bimanual dexterous manipulation remains a significant challenge in robotics due to the high DoFs of each hand and their coordination. Existing single-hand manipulation techniques often leverage human demonstrations to guide RL methods but fail to generalize to complex bimanual tasks involving multiple sub-skills. In this paper, we propose VTAO-BiManip, a novel framework that integrates visual-tactile-action pre-training with object understanding, aiming to enable human-like bimanual manipulation via curriculum RL. We improve prior learning by incorporating hand motion data, providing more effective guidance for dual-hand coordination. Our pretraining model predicts future actions as well as object pose and size using masked multimodal inputs, facilitating cross-modal regularization. To address the multi-skill learning challenge, we introduce a two-stage curriculum RL approach to stabilize training. We evaluate our method on a bimanual bottle-cap twisting task, demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments. Our approach achieves a success rate that surpasses existing visual-tactile pretraining methods by over 20%."
Adaptive Visuo-Tactile Fusion with Predictive Force Attention for Dexterous Manipulation,"Effectively utilizing multi-sensory data is important for robots to generalize across diverse tasks. However, the heterogeneous nature of these modalities makes fusion challenging. Existing methods propose strategies to obtain comprehensively fused features but often ignore the fact that each modality requires different levels of attention at different manipulation stages. To address this, we propose a force-guided attention fusion module that adaptively adjusts the weights of visual and tactile features without human labeling. We also introduce a self-supervised future force prediction auxiliary task to reinforce the tactile modality, improve data imbalance, and encourage proper adjustment. Our method achieves an average success rate of 93% across three fine-grained, contact-rich tasks in real-world experiments. Further analysis shows that our policy appropriately adjusts attention to each modality at different manipulation stages."
PNEUmorph: A Shape-Morphing Interface Comprising a Pneumatic Membrane Constrained by Variable-Length Tendons,"Soft shape-morphing technologies are explored in fields such as soft robotics, metamaterials and design, enabling systems to adapt dynamically through elastic deformations. Applied in mobile devices, actuators, interactive objects and environments, these systems can respond to functional needs and environmental stimuli, communicating information and enhancing human experiences. A primary design goal for these systems is achieving extensive and complex shape transformations. Traditionally, soft robotics employs a pneumatic active layer constrained by a passive layer, limiting the deformation range. However, using dual active layers can expand deformation potential. Expanding on these principles, this work introduces PNEUmorph: a pneumatic surface constrained by a network of variable-length tendons, allowing broader shape transformations than traditional single-layer systems. PNEUmorphâ€™s dual-layer actuation overcomes fixed deformation limits, significantly enhancing shape-morphing capabilities. This paper presents PNEUmorphâ€™s design and preliminary geometrical characterization, achieved through an interdisciplinary approach that merges design and soft robotics methods. This study details methods for simulation, fabrication, operation and evaluation, offering insights into experimental results and directions for advancing surface-based soft shape-morphing systems."
Eversion Robot for Endoscopic Vein Harvesting,"Soft eversion robots have demonstrated significant advantages in navigating within confined spaces with minimal friction, making them promising candidates for various intraluminal applications in medical, industrial, and exploratory domains. These types of growing robots enable frictionless movement within hollow structures. This paper introduces a novel growing robotic manipulator. The area of medical application is endoscopic vein harvesting. We present the design, implementation, and experimental validation of this eversion robot, investigating its growth behavior under varying pressure values and with different diameters, its ability to navigate along defined trajectories, and with a tool mounted to its tip. This eversion robot could enable vein dissection while preserving the surrounding fat layer, making it a promising innovation for minimally invasive vascular surgery and beyond."
Origami-Inspired Soft Gripper with Tunable Constant Force Output,"Soft robotic grippers gently and safely manipulate delicate objects due to their inherent adaptability and softness. Limited by insufficient stiffness and imprecise force control, conventional soft grippers are not suitable for applications that require stable grasping force. In this work, we propose a soft gripper that utilizes an origami-inspired structure to achieve tunable constant force output over a wide strain range. The geometry of each taper panel is established to provide necessary parameters such as protrusion distance, taper angle, and crease thickness required for 3D modeling and FEA analysis. Simulations and experiments show that by optimizing these parameters, our design can achieve a tunable constant force output. Moreover, the origami-inspired soft gripper dynamically adapts to different shapes while preventing excessive forces, with potential applications in logistics, manufacturing, and other industrial settings that require stable and adaptive operations."
"Grasp EveryThing (GET): 1-DoF, 3-Fingered Gripper with Tactile Sensing for Robust Grasping","We introduce the Grasp EveryThing (GET) gripper, a novel 1-DoF, 3-finger design for securely grasping objects of many shapes and sizes. Mounted on a standard parallel jaw actuator, the design features three narrow, tapered fingers arranged in a two-against-one configuration, where the two fingers converge into a V-shape. The GET gripper is more capable of conforming to object geometries and forming secure grasps than traditional designs with two flat fingers. Inspired by the principle of self-similarity, these V-shaped fingers enable secure grasping across a wide range of object sizes. Further to this end, fingers are parametrically designed for convenient resizing and interchangeability across robotic embodiments with a parallel jaw gripper. Additionally, we incorporate a rigid fingernail for ease in manipulating small objects. Tactile sensing can be integrated into the standalone finger via an externally-mounted camera. A neural network was trained to estimate normal force from tactile images with an average validation error of 1.3 N across a diverse set of geometries. In grasping 15 objects and performing 3 tasks via teleoperation, the GET fingers consistently outperformed standard flat fingers. All finger designs, compatible with multiple robotic embodiments, both incorporating and lacking tactile sensing, are available on"
A Rigid-Flexible Coupled Bionic Robotic Finger with Perception Decoupling and Slip Detection Capabilities,"Human fingertips are densely distributed with sensory nerve endings, allowing them to perceive various physical characteristics, including pressure, roughness, etc. In this work, we develop a rigid-flexible coupled bionic robotic finger with perception decoupling and slip detection capabilities. Particularly, slip perception is important in grasping operations. Timely prediction of slippage and adjusting gripping force can improve gripping stability. Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are embedded within both the rigid skeleton and flexible shell of the bionic fingertip. The fibers within the flexible shell are capable of sensing slight pressure, while the optical fibers embedded in the rigid skeleton can measure temperature changes. Firstly, this paper introduces the principles of distributed fiber optic sensors and the morphological design of the bionic fingertip. Then, the fabrication process of the bionic fingertip is described. Finally, we verify the multimodal sensory capabilities of the bionic fingertip through a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that the bionic finger can successfully sense whether the slip has occurred during grasping process. In summary, this rigid-flexible bionic finger is expected to play a significant role in dexterous manipulation, fruit picking and so on."
SPARK Hand: Scooping-Pinching Adaptive Robotic Hand with Kempe Mechanism for Passive Grasp in Environmental Constraints,"This paper presents the SPARK Finger, an innovative passive adaptive robotic finger capable of executing both parallel pinching and scooping grasps. The SPARK Finger incorporates a multi-link mechanism with Kempe linkages to achieve a vertical linear fingertip trajectory. Furthermore, a parallelogram linkage ensures the fingertip maintains a fixed orientation relative to the base, facilitating precise and stable manipulation. By integrating these mechanisms with elastic elements, the design enables effective interaction with surfaces, such as tabletops, to handle challenging objects. The finger employs a passive switching mechanism that facilitates seamless transitions between pinching and scooping modes, adapting automatically to various object shapes and environmental constraints without additional actuators. To demonstrate its versatility, the SPARK Hand, equipped with two SPARK Fingers, has been developed. This system exhibits enhanced grasping performance and stability for objects of diverse sizes and shapes, particularly thin and flat objects that are traditionally challenging for conventional grippers. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the SPARK design, highlighting its potential for robotic manipulation in constrained and dynamic environments."
Design of a Reconfigurable Gripper with Rigid-Flexible Variable Fingers (I),"Grippers with a single rigid or flexible state have corresponding limitations, such as poor safety of rigid grippers and low precision of flexible grippers, which require complex algorithms and additional sensors to perform tedious tasks. Here, we design a reconfigurable gripper based on three fingers that can switch among the rigid, rigid bending and flexible states. This adaptability enables the gripper to perform in diverse application scenarios. The flexible joints are locked and released by the back and forth movement of a slider mechanism, thus enabling switches between the rigid and flexible states of the fingers. When the fingers are in the rigid state, the structure resembles a conventional rigid gripper; when the fingers are in the flexible state, the spring supported joints are driven by four cables. We have developed the mathematical models for the three states, tested the performance of different grasping configurations, analyzed the factors that influence horizontal grasping errors, and finally explored the application of rigid-flexible cooperative operations. Numerical and empirical experimental results clearly demonstrate the viability of the proposed gripper and its wide adaptability to different tasks."
Reconfigurable Soft Pneumatic Actuators Using Multi-Material Self-Healing Polymers,"Self-healing polymers, which can autonomously repair damage or be repaired through simple treatments, have garnered attention due to their flexibility in addressing damage and enabling long-term use in soft robotics. Many studies on the application of self-healing polymers to soft robotics have focused on realizing healable systems. Such a mechanism makes it possible to construct soft robots. Despite previous research on reconfigurable soft robots, the reconfiguration of actuators ―critical components for determining actuation―has not been explored extensively. We propose a method for constructing reconfigurable soft pneumatic actuators using multi-material selfhealing polymers, thus enhancing the adaptability and functionality of soft robotic systems. The actuator comprises stretchable and less-stretchable self-healing polymers, which allow for durable and versatile configurations. By adjusting the placement of the less-stretchable polymer on the actuator surface, we can design and alter the deformation, thus achieving various forms of actuation. Our research demonstrates the feasibility of actuators capable of bending, contracting, twisting, and elongating. We provide examples of their application in actuator fabrication, thus showcasing the potential of our study in inspiring the design and fabrication of soft robots utilizing self-healing polymers."
Haptic-Informed ACT with a Soft Gripper and Recovery-Informed Training for Pseudo Oocyte Manipulation,"In this paper, we introduce Haptic-Informed ACT, an advanced robotic system for pseudo oocyte manipulation, integrating multimodal information and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT). Traditional automation methods for oocyte transfer rely heavily on visual perception, often requiring human supervision due to biological variability and environmental disturbances. Haptic-Informed ACT enhances ACT by incorporating haptic feedback, enabling real-time grasp failure detection and adaptive correction. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-printed TPU soft gripper to facilitate delicate manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate that Haptic-Informed ACT improves the task success rate, robustness, and adaptability compared to conventional ACT, particularly in dynamic environments. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning in robotics for biomedical automation."
Stress-Driven Algorithm for Fiber Alignment in Smart Materials for Controlled Deformation in 4D-Printed Soft Robotics,"This work proposes a path generation policy for self-actuating soft grippers by converting external deformation conditions into intrinsic load conditions. This transformation enables anisotropic material orientation control of functional materials - which can deform under stimuli - aligning with the deformation requirements of soft grippers to enhance controllability. Given a desired deformation for an arbitrary geometry, finite element method (FEM) analysis is used to determine the internal stress distribution. The second-order stress tensor is transformed into a traction vector field, guiding the alignment of material anisotropy for optimal deformation. A computational framework is developed to generate smooth, continuous printing paths by integrating along the vector field, ensuring internal morphology control of the target geometry. The proposed method is validated through FEM analysis, demonstrating a positional deviation rate of under 5% relative to the largest geometric feature in each test case across various tested shapes and deformation conditions. The results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively generates 4D printing paths that enable soft grippers to achieve target deformations with high matching rate."
A Novel Robot Hand with Hoeckens Linkages and Soft Phalanges for Scooping and Self-Adaptive Grasping in Environmental Constraints,"This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage, and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes: parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance. Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's performance.Experimental validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability."
A Bionic Robotic Hand Designed with Multiple Grasping Modes and Magnetic Tactile Perception,"Abstractâ€”This paper presents a novel multi-mode bionic robotic hand. Its bionic finger (BIF) ingeniously combines a magnetic-silica-gel skin with a rigid skeletal framework and integrates a vacuum suction cup at the fingertip. This design enables the bionic manipulator to execute multiple grasping modes, namely enveloping, parallel, and suction grasping. The proposed BIF emulates the skeletal structure of human fingers and equips the fingertip with suction-based grasping functionality, thus achieving both formal bionics and functional superiority. The overall grasping space range of the bionic manipulator can be determined through the computation of the offset of the steel wire, which corresponds to the bending angles of the three joints of the finger. Furthermore, by discerning the four phases within the bionic manipulatorâ€™s object-grasping process, in-depth exploration is carried out regarding the unique data characteristics of the magnetic-tactile sensing unit during the grasping operation. On this basis, an accurate prediction of the grasped objectâ€™s diameter is achieved. We constructed an autonomous grasping operation platform by integrating an external depth camera with the robotic arm to assess the fundamental performance of this robotic hand in grasping diverse objects."
High-Dynamic Tactile Sensing for Tactile Servo Manipulation: Let Robots Swing a Hammer,"High-dynamic tactile sensing and tactile servo control present challenges in robustness and real-time performance. This paper proposes a closed-loop tactile servo control strategy for robotic nail hammering, by allowing controlled hammer slide within a rigid robotic 2-finger gripper. The proposed approach detects tactile information of continuous sliding and sliding-induced vibrations in real time and modulates gripping force. The control encourages rotational sliding to enhance impact and reduce recoil while restricting parallel slippage to maintain grip stability. To achieve real-time processing and effective sliding feature extraction, we employ Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and a dual-stream Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) model, processing tactile data at 1 kHz with an average latency of 1.04 ms. Experimental results show that, compared to conventional methods, controlling hammer slippage reduces arm joint recoil by 64.26% (223.30 N → 79.81 N) while increasing hammer impact force by 179.97% (28.06 N → 78.56 N). The method adapts to hammers with varying mass distributions, significantly improving impact resilience and manipulation performance in high-dynamic interactions. These advancements pave the way for more dexterous and robust robotic systems with embodied intelligence."
Development of Wearable Assistive Robots Using Artificial Muscle for Older Adults,"Age-related sarcopeniaâ€”a progressive decline in muscle mass and strengthâ€”compromises postural stability in older adults, underscoring the urgent need for effective assistive robotic solutions. However, existing assistive technologies often suffer from mechanical, kinematic, and control incompatibilities with the human body. In response, we present a wearable assistive robotic system that integrates muscle-like actuation and control algorithms to directly compensate for impaired muscle force generation at the physiological level. To address mechanical incompatibility, the system employs artificial muscle actuators that replicate the contraction dynamics of human muscles. By mimicking the natural direction of muscle force generation and the anatomical anchor points of muscle attachment, it also resolves kinematic incompatibility. Furthermore, the system uses real-time electromyography (EMG) signals for neuromuscular sensing and implements a muscle-like recruitment and rate coding algorithm to control twisted fiber soft actuators, thereby addressing control incompatibility through human-in-the-loop signal integration. A comprehensive evaluation using the Functional Reach Test (FRT) with ten older adults demonstrated a 16.6 average increase in total ankle joint torque and a statistically significant improvement in forward reach distance (from 66.4 Â± 17.4 cm in the OFF condition to 77.2 Â± 16.6 cm in the ON condition). These findings highlight the systemâ€™s potential to mitigate age-related muscle decline and establish a novel muscle-like actuationâ€“motionâ€“control paradigm for wearable assistive robotics."
Soft Actuators with Integrated Electrohydrodynamic Pump and Intrinsic Electroadhesion,"Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps made from flexible or stretchable materials are a promising pumping element for fluidically driven soft robots. In most soft robotic systems, EHD pumps are used separately or connected in series with their target components, such as actuators, which can limit design flexibility and complicate implementation. To address this issue, this paper presents an EHD soft actuator that integrates a pump, actuator, and reservoir into a single device. In this design, the EHD pump is implemented as a flexible PCB, which also serves as a strain-limiting layer, enhancing bending actuation. Additionally, the interdigitated electrodes on the flexible PCB generate fringe electric fields, introducing electroadhesion as an unprecedented functionality for EHD-driven soft actuators. Experimental results from the fabricated actuators demonstrate voltage-controllable actuation, achieving a maximum bending angle of 56.0Â° and a force of 31.0 mN. The actuators are then incorporated into a soft gripper, where electroadhesion enhances the holding force, with a 1.3Ã— increase for a dielectric object and a 2.9Ã— increase for a conductive object. These enhancements are observed in comparison to a control experiment in which gripping is performed using non-electric, fluidic actuation alone. The results validate the successful implementation of the highly integrated, multifunctional EHD soft actuator, highlighting its potential for soft robotic applications."
Stretchable and High-Precision Optical Tactile Sensor for Trajectory Tracking of Parallel Mechanisms,"Stretchable sensors indicate promising prospects for soft robotics, medical devices, and human-machine interactions due to the high compliance of soft materials. Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with a self-decoupled capacity of magnitude with position from tactile stimuli and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors. Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor with a parallel-assembled structure based on the proposed continuous spectral filtering principle, allowing superhigh spatial and force resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (R^2＞0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness. We further demonstrate the sensors' performance by integrating them into a five-bar parallel mechanism for precise trajectory tracking (rotational resolution: 0.02Â°) in real time."
SMA-TENG Actuator with Tactile Sensing Capability,"Shape memory alloy (SMA) is widely employed in developing actuators. However, the lack of sensing capabilities limits its application. This study presents a sensing-actuation integrated device based on SMA and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), achieving tactile sensing while maintaining the actuation performance. The proposed core-shell structure not only repurposes the SMA spring as a key component of actuation and sensing, but also effectively isolates the actuation current to prevent interference with the sensing signal. The aerogel-modified silicone composite layer is applied to the SMA to reduce temperature rise by 30.56%, ensuring the sensing performance. With a rapid response time of less than 31 ms and stable sensing performance exceeding 2000 cycles, the SMA-TENG actuator reliably detects dynamically varying forces and bending. Additionally, it generates a maximum actuation force of 3.21 N, which represents a 12.2% increase compared to a standard SMA spring, due to the pre-stress introduced by the composite layer. Moreover, it can actuate a displacement of 7.7 cm and exhibiting a power density of 7.15 Ã— 10Â³ W/mÂ³(at 0.84 V, 6 A). Finally, we validate its haptic sensing capability during actuation, demonstrating its potential towards interactive robotic systems."

A Variable Sensing Range Electrical Impedance Tomography Sensor for Robot Electric Skins,While stretchable and compressible sensors are commonly used to enhance
Mirror Adaptive Impedance Control of Multi-Mode Soft Exoskeleton with Reinforcement Learning (I),"Soft exoskeleton robots (exosuits) have exhibited promising potentials in walking assistance with comfortable wearing experience. In this paper, a twisted string actuator (TSA) is developed and equipped with the exosuit to provide powerful driving force and variable assistance intensity for hemiplegic patients, which provides human-domain and robotdomain training modes for subjects with different movement capabilities. Since the human-exosuit coupling dynamics is difficult to be modeled due to the soft structure of the exosuit and incomplete knowledge of the wearerâ€™s performance, accurate control and efficient assistance cannot be guaranteed in current exosuits. By taking advantage of the motion characteristic of hemiplegic patients, a mirror adaptive impedance control is proposed, where the robotic actuation is modulated based on the motion and physiological reference of the healthy limb (HL) as well as the performance of the impaired limb (IL). A linear quadratic regulation (LQR) is formulated to minimize the bilateral trajectory tracking errors and human effort, and the adaptation between the human-domain and robot-domain modes can be realized. A reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is designed to solve the given LQR problem to optimize the impedance parameters with little information of the human or robot model. The proposed robotic system is validated through experiments to perform its effectiveness and superiority."

Furthermore, we introduce a novel Dynamic Weighting Coefficient Layer (DWCL) to dynamically optimize fusion weights for each modality based on real-time input characteristics, thereby enhancing robustness against magnetic interference. The DWCL leverages temporal discrepancies between modalities during pre-contact sensing and quantifies the magnetic field strength of target objects to autonomously adjust fusion ratios, prioritizing the more reliable modality under varying interference conditions. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed DWCL significantly improves interference resistance compared to conventional fusion methods, advancing the feasibility of magnetic tactile sensing in real-world environments."
A Natural Human-Robot Interaction System for Teleoperation Based on Noncontact Haptic Feedback,"In order to provide natural and immersive interactive experience for teleoperation in the context of human-robot collaboration and interaction, this work introduces a natural human-robot interaction system for teleoperation based on ultrasonic haptic feedback. Specifically, our system can accurately capture an operator's hand movements and replicate these actions on the remote robot with low latency and high fidelity.

Co-designed, open-source VBTS and MBTS with identical contact modules enable synchronized data collection of high-resolution shapes and magnetic signals via a symmetric calibration setup. We frame tactile shape reconstruction as a conditional generative problem, employing a conditional variational auto-encoder to infer high-resolution shapes from low-resolution MBTS inputs. The MBTS achieves a sampling frequency of 125 Hz, whereas the shape reconstruction sustains an inference time within 2.5 ms. This cross-modality synergy advances tactile perception of the MBTS, potentially unlocking its new capabilities in high-precision robotic tasks."

This research demonstrates the noise degradation performance of SCNNs in a tactile task, and outlines the potential of a single SCNN to generalize across several dimensions of uncertainty."
Self-Sensing Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuator with Magnetic-Thermal Synergy,"Fueled by the rapid evolution of robotics, the demand for intelligent and lightweight robotic systems continues to grow across industries. However, conventional designs often separate sensing and actuation, resulting in structural complexity and diminished reliability. While integrated sensor-actuator systems offer a promising solution, they face significant challenges in manufacturing and scalability. Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) are widely utilized in actuators for their thermally responsive deformation and programmability, while Neodymi-um-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) nanoparticles provide exceptional magnetic properties for sensing.

The Vision-Based Tactile Sensor (VBTS) represents a significant advancement in tactile sensing, utilizing cameras to monitor the deformation of soft materials at the sensor tip. Pressure applied to the sensor alters the light propagation path, thereby changing the image captured by the camera. By combining image processing and deep learning, VBTS provides highly accurate estimates of contact position and force, achieving micrometer-level resolution. This paper presents a novel VBTS design that leverages a light-conductive plate and a silicone membrane to enhance the sensor's sensitivity to force perception. The soft, thin nature of the silicone membrane allows for precise detection of minimal forces, making it suitable for tasks involving highly deformable objects. Experimental results demonstrate the sensor's capability in detecting contact areas and force distributions, which can be applied in diverse domains such as soft object assembly, medical assistance, and food processing. Moreover, the proposed VBTS outperforms traditional sensors by utilizing computationally efficient algorithms that maintain real-time performance without compromising resolution."
Soft Tactile Sensors for Robot Grippers Using Acoustic Sensing,"We present a low-cost, soft tactile sensor using common, easily sourced materials that can be integrated with existing robotic gripper systems without requiring complex fabrication techniques or expensive components. Our approach includes two designs: a flexible linear sensor constructed from a rubber tube and a planar sensor made with a rubber membrane stretched over an enclosure. Both sensors contain an embedded speaker and microphones that leverage active acoustic sensing to map the unique acoustic resonant response of the cavity's structure to deformations that occur when the robotic gripper is grasping an object. Experimental results demonstrate that, using a support vector machine, the linear sensor achieves contact point estimation with an RMSE of 6mm, while the planar sensor achieves an RMSE of 0.57-0.62mm. Additionally, the planar sensor classifies six objects with an accuracy of 97.7%. These results demonstrate the potential for active acoustics to be an accessible method for enabling tactile sensing capabilities for robotic systems."
Electrical Impedance Tomography Based Finger-Shaped Soft Artificial Skin,"Obtaining dense contact information for feedback control is vital for robotic manipulation. However, existing tactile sensing technologies have a large footprint, making seamless integration with current robotic devices difficult. This paper presents a novel multi-layer Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) sensor architecture designed to provide distributed, high-density tactile sensing with a small form factor. Using our multilayer structure, we address a common issue in other EIT-based tactile skins that prevents electrodes from being placed distally from the sensing surface. Our innovative multi-layer design enables the development of complex-shaped soft sensing skins without any electronic components on the sensing surface, achieving very high accuracy. To demonstrate practical applications, we fabricated a finger-shaped three-dimensional (3D) skin and conducted experiments to collect real-world data.

If tactile sensors could be fabricated and integrated more easily, their applicability would further expand. In this study, we propose a tactile sensorâ€”M3D-skinâ€”that can be easily fabricated with high versatility by leveraging the infill patterns of a multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the sensing principle. This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations.

A Multimodal Robust Recognition Method for Grasping Objects with Robot Flexible Grippers (I),"In light of the critical importance of achieving robust object recognition from multimodal data in robotic operations, this article proposes a precise identification method tailored for the grasping of objects using a multi-flexible gripper in scenarios characterized by multimodality, limited samples, and complex environments. Terming the BOSS-MI-ELM algorithm, this approach innovatively extracts [bag-of-SFA-symbols (BOSS)], fusion [association-based fusion (AF)], and classifies [incremental extreme learning machine (I-ELM)] features from multimodal data, facilitating an efficient recognition process. The study employs fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) as information acquisition components, constructing a multimodal perception system and establishing a corresponding grasping dataset. Through training and testing on this dataset, empirical evidence demonstrates that even with the utilization of only 20% of the dataset, the BOSS-MI-ELM algorithm maintains a classification accuracy of 95.54%. In the presence of Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and varying standard deviations, as well as different degrees of partial data loss, the proposed method still maintains robust recognition performance. In addition, we have validated the effectiveness of this method in identifying objects grasped at different speeds. Furthermore, comparative experiments were conducted on two publicly available multimodal tactile datasets. The results indicate that the BOSS-MI-ELM algorithm outperforms various baseline models. The extensive experiments collectively demonstrate that this system provides a viable solution for robot object recognition under multimodal tactile perception."
A Deep Reinforcement Learning Based End-To-End Control Framework for Lower Limb Exoskeletons with Smooth Movement Transitions,"This paper presents an active control strategy for lower limb exoskeletons by proposing an end-to-end framework employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enable smooth transitions between different movement patterns. The majority of existing methods in exoskeleton literature employ finite state machines (FSM) that have proven successful in predicting the control strategy for the next state on the basis of sensor data such as IMU data, force, etc. However, one drawback of FSM occurs due to their inflexibility regarding sudden changes. Specifically, FSM is based on clear state transitions, which makes it hard to manage smooth continuous movements and increases the chance of sudden changes in control during transitions. These, in turn, raise safety concerns for the user. While learning-based control approaches have been suggested in recent years, the validation was performed in simulation environments. Therefore, the real-world applicability remains an open research question to date. To address this issue, we provide the first contribution in this field that proposes an end-to-end learning framework with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) module to enable smooth transitions between movement patterns under real-world conditions. By introducing several evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in terms of the adaptability and smoothness in movement transitions."
VibeCheck: Using Active Acoustic Tactile Sensing for Contact-Rich Manipulation,"The acoustic response of an object can reveal a lot about its global state, for example its material properties or the extrinsic contacts it is making with the world. In this work, we build an active acoustic sensing gripper equipped with two piezoelectric fingers: one for generating signals, the other for receiving them. By sending an acoustic vibration from one finger to the other through an object, we gain insight into an object's acoustic properties and contact state. We use this system to classify objects, estimate grasping position, estimate poses of internal structures, and classify the types of extrinsic contacts an object is making with the environment. Using our contact type classification model, we tackle a standard long-horizon manipulation problem: peg insertion. We use a simple simulated transition model based on the performance of our sensor to train an imitation learning policy that is robust to imperfect predictions from the classifier. We finally demonstrate the policy on a UR5 robot with active acoustic sensing as the only feedback. Videos can be found at https://roamlab.github.io/vibecheck."
"TwinTac: A Wide-Range, Highly Sensitive Tactile Sensor with Real-To-Sim Digital Twin Sensor Model","Robot skill acquisition processes driven by reinforcement learning often rely on simulations to efficiently generate large-scale interaction data. However, the absence of simulation models for tactile sensors has hindered the use of tactile sensing in such skill learning processes, limiting the development of effective policies driven by tactile perception. To bridge this gap, we present TwinTac, a system that combines the design of a physical tactile sensor with its digital twin model. Our hardware sensor is designed for high sensitivity and a wide measurement range, enabling high quality sensing data essential for object interaction tasks. Building upon the hardware sensor, we develop the digital twin model using a real-to-sim approach. This involves collecting synchronized cross-domain data, including finite element method results and the physical sensor's outputs, and then training neural networks to map simulated data to real sensor responses. Through experimental evaluation, we characterized the sensitivity of the physical sensor and demonstrated the consistency of the digital twin in replicating the physical sensorâ€™s output. Furthermore, by conducting an object classification task, we showed that simulation data generated by our digital twin sensor can effectively augment real-world data, leading to improved accuracy. These results highlight TwinTac's potential to bridge the gap in cross-domain learning tasks."
A Compliant Tube for Series Elastic Actuators to Generate High Output Torque,"Series elastic actuators (SEAs) achieve output torque and stiffness control by managing the deformation of a spring arranged between the motor and the output. SEAs are ideal for tasks involving human-robot interaction and unstructured environments. The stiffness, size, and torque capacity of the spring are crucial for the performance of an SEA. To increase the torque capacity of an SEA while maintaining a compact size, this paper proposes a novel helical flexure as the spring in an SEA. The helical flexure is formed on the thin wall of a tube to generate high torque output with minimal reaction forces and moments. The resulting compliant tube can be combined with other transmission components to reduce the number of components and allow the inner passage of cables and shafts. Simulation comparisons and experimental testing verify the merits of the proposed helical flexure. An SEA prototype is fabricated to demonstrate the performance of the new helical flexure during zero-torque and high-torque motion."

A compliant pulley and a compliant cap are introduced, enabling embedded torque sensing without the need for external sensors, thereby reducing system complexity and improving response time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the wrist in torque accuracy and misalignment correction during peg-in-hole assembly, highlighting the benefits of the compliant-driven torque sensing approach. Compared to existing robotic wrists, the proposed design achieves a higher torque density. The findings contribute to advancing robotic wrist technology, particularly in applications requiring precise force modulation, high dexterity, and adaptable compliance."
A Lightweight 3-Axis Permanent Magnetic Sponge-Based Self-Adapting Tactile Sensor,"Tactile sensors are indispensable in robotic systems because they deliver vital contact information during environmental interactions. In our work, we leverage the variable compliance of a porous materialâ€”where different interaction forces induce varying degrees of complianceâ€”to achieve self-adapting tactile sensing. This distinctive non-linear characteristic allows its sensitivity to be tuned over a range from 0.008 mT/N to 0.045 mT/N. After coating with a magnetic polymer, the porous material functions as a 3-axis magnetic sensing medium. Its length and width are set at 30 mm and 35 mm respectively to accommodate the printed circuit board. To preserve the overall measuring range, it is designed with a thickness of 15 mm. This thickness enables monitoring of the volumetric changes due to the enhanced compliance, which is suitable for three-dimensional shape recognition. In this work, we present the design, fabrication, experimental characterization, and applications of an lightweight 3-axis magnetic sponge sensor with overall dimensions of 30 mm (width) Ã— 35 mm (length) Ã— 17 mm (height) and a detection range of 60 N. Notably, the sensing material weighs only 2 g, thanks to its porous structure."
Muscle-On-A-Chip: A Self-Healing Actuator Platform in Robotic Systems,"The regulation of muscle function is very important for tissue engineering and sports science. This paper presents a simple microfluidic chip platform and its control method to investigate the regulation of muscle function. By employing C2C12 cells as the model system for skeletal muscle research, these cells were inoculated onto the microfluidic chips and induced to differentiate into fully functional muscle tubes. Programmable actuation control enables localized strain gradients within the microfluidic platform, achieving differential mechanical regimes for functional modulation of integrated muscle constructs. The system implements mechanical conditioning to recapitulate exercise-induced myocyte damage and subsequent regenerative processes through controlled deformation protocols. Our radial-strain actuators generate 19.4% maximum principal strain, while axial-strain configurations achieve 8.3% baseline deformation. Dynamic input modulation enables precise strain reduction to 7.4% and 2.2%, respectively establishing differential mechanical regimes for simulating exercise-associated functional impairment (high-strain phase) and recovery processes (low-strain phase). This strain-programmable platform establishes a robust framework for investigating mechanobiological thresholds in functional muscle regeneration."
Touch-Linked Sleeve: A Haptic Interface for Augmented Tactile Perception in Robotic Teleoperation,"Tactile perception is crucial for robots to interact effectively with their environments, particularly in cluttered settings or when visual sensing is unavailable. However, a major limitation is the insufficient coverage of tactile sensors on current robots, which makes navigating cluttered spaces challenging due to the lack of capability to detect collisions. This limitation also hinders the use of teleoperation systems in such spaces by reducing the human operatorâ€™s situational awareness. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Touch-Linked Sleeve (TLS), a haptic mapping system that redirects contact on robot arms to human skin. The system consists of a tactile skin for contact detection and a haptic sleeve that enables human operators to experience telepresented contact. By establishing a transparent mapping between the robot's tactile skin and the user's haptic sleeve, operators can intuitively sense contacts from the robotâ€™s perspective. To evaluate the systemâ€™s effectiveness, we conducted experiments demonstrating the functionality of both the tactile skin and the haptic sleeve. Moreover, we performed human studies using a virtual reality robot teleoperation interface to simulate navigation and manipulation in a cluttered scenario. The results indicate that the proposed system enhances perceptual transparency during object grasping tasks, leading to improved task completion times, fewer collisions, and improved overall usability."
Wearing a Robotic Hand to Feel 3D Force Feedback: Analysis and Virtual Reality Application of the Hand-In-Hand System,"Virtual Reality (VR) robot embodiment is a popular method for teleoperation and generating data to train AI control systems. A potential flaw with this approach is an incongruence in human-robot haptics. Without tactile feedback, teleoperators depend on visual cues, leading to suboptimal performance (slow movement, faulty grasps, excessive contact force). This problem is exacerbated during robot hand teleoperation. Worse, many haptic hand wearables are cable-driven and only produce unidirectional resistive force, thus failing to cover the gamut of 3D finger interactions. In this paper, a critical gap in teleoperated human-robot hand haptics is addressed by transforming an inexpensive (~500 USD) 3D-printed robotic hand into a wearable exoskeletonâ€”the ""Hand-in-Hand"" (HiH) systemâ€”which provides fingertip 3D force feedback. Methods for force control, null-space optimization, and human finger pose estimation are presented and experimentally validated. Each finger of the device can produce a maximum of 1 N of force feedback in any 3D direction. HiH finger tracking is compared to an industry-grade device (MANUS Metagloves, 5000 USD) and realizes an average inferred joint position Normalized Root Mean Square Error of 33.46%. Lastly, the HiH is demonstrated within a VR robot embodiment experiment with force feedback. Operator hand-manipulation performance improved when using force feedback, emphasizing the HiH's potential for teleoperated robot control and data collection."
AeroHaptix: A Wearable Vibrotactile Feedback System for Enhancing Collision Avoidance in UAV Teleoperation,"Haptic feedback enhances collision avoidance by providing directional obstacle information to operators during unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teleoperation. However, such feedback is often rendered via haptic joysticks, which are unfamiliar to UAV operators and limited to single-direction force feedback. Additionally, the direct coupling between the input device and the feedback method diminishes operators' sense of control and induces oscillatory movements. To overcome these limitations, we propose AeroHaptix, a wearable haptic feedback system that uses spatial vibrations to simultaneously communicate multiple obstacle directions to operators, without interfering with their input control. The layout of vibrotactile actuators was optimized via a perceptual study to eliminate perceptual biases and achieve uniform spatial coverage. A novel rendering algorithm, MultiCBF, extended control barrier functions to support multi-directional feedback. Our system evaluation showed that compared to a no-feedback condition, AeroHaptix effectively reduced the number of collisions and input disagreement. Furthermore, operators reported that AeroHaptix was more helpful than force feedback, with improved situational awareness and comparable workload."
A Lightweight Haptic Interface for Hand-To-Object Tasks with Spatiotemporal Displays (I),"Haptic interfaces create information transmission channels from machine to human with a natural way. Robust haptic interfaces with compact forms that provide high information throughput are of particular interest in industrial applications such as teleoperation, soft displays, virtual, and augmented reality. Here, we propose a haptic interface with spatiotemporal displays to convey high-dimensional information during successive hand-to-object tasks, which is architectural and psychophysical lightweight. The wearable and flexible architecture incorporates seven independently addressable vibration units at a pitch of 16 mm to allow spatiotemporal modulation. To prove the superiority of the haptic interface, four-day perceptual experiments are performed on 12 subjects with pattern discrimination tasks. We compared recognition accuracy (RA) between space-dependent and spatiotemporal strategies across the forearm, which are encoded based on finger states and morphological deformations. Furthermore, the mixed biomimetic strategy derived from both is intuitive and showed strength in terms of RA (over 88%) and information transfer (IT) (over 2.4 bit/s). With prior knowledge, are significantly better (RA over 90%) at the discrimination of sequential patterns. Moreover, the results demonstrate robust performance of the biomimetic strategy on location shift, which prove that subjects perceive relative information among vibratory units rather than absolute locations on the skin."

This system incorporates biologically inspired encoding schemes that convert multimodal sensory data into spike trains, enabling highly efficient processing through Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By utilizing these neuromorphic signals, the proposed framework achieves 97.14% accuracy in object recognition across varying poses, significantly outperforming previous studies on soft hands. Additionally, we introduce a novel differentiator neuron model to enhance material classification by capturing dynamic thermal responses. Our results demonstrate the benefits of multimodal sensory fusion and highlight the potential of neuromorphic approaches for achieving efficient, robust, and human-like perception in robotic systems."
Disambiguate Gripper State in Grasp-Based Tasks: Pseudo-Tactile As Feedback Enables Pure Simulation Learning,"Grasp-based manipulation tasks are fundamental to robots interacting with their environments, yet gripper state ambiguity significantly reduces the robustness of imitation learning policies for these tasks. Data-driven solutions face the challenge of high real-world data costs, while simulation data, despite its low costs, is limited by the sim-to-real gap. We identify the root cause of gripper state ambiguity as the lack of tactile feedback. To address this, we propose a novel approach employing pseudo-tactile as feedback, inspired by the idea of using a force-controlled gripper as a tactile sensor. This method enhances policy robustness without additional data collection and hardware involvement, while providing a noise-free binary gripper state observation for the policy and thus facilitating pure simulation learning to unleash the power of simulation. Experimental results across three real-world grasp-based tasks demonstrate the necessity, effectiveness, and efficiency of our approach."

3D Vision-Tactile Reconstruction from Infrared and Visible Images for Robotic Fine-Grained Tactile Perception,"To achieve human-like haptic perception in anthropomorphic grippers, the compliant sensing surfaces of vision tactile sensor (VTS) must evolve from conventional planar configurations to biomimetically curved topographies with continuous surface gradients. However, planar VTSs have challenges when extended to curved surfaces, including insufficient lighting of surfaces, blurring in reconstruction, and complex spatial boundary conditions for surface structures. With an end goal of constructing a human-like fingertip, our research (i) develops GelSplitter3D by expanding imaging channels with a prism and a near-infrared (NIR) camera, (ii) proposes a photometric stereo neural network with a CAD-based normal ground truth generation method to calibrate tactile geometry, and (iii) devises a normal integration method with boundary constraints of depth prior information to correcting the cumulative error of surface integrals. We demonstrate better tactile sensing performance, a 40% improvement in normal estimation accuracy, and the benefits of sensor shapes in grasping and manipulation tasks."
A Multi-Layered Quantitative Assessment Approach for Hand Spasticity Based on a Cable-Actuated Hand Exoskeleton,"Over the past two decades, numerous hand exoskeletons have been developed for rehabilitation scenarios, yet very few have the capability to assess spasticity. This paper introduces a quantitative assessment approach for hand spasticity developed on a cable-driven hand exoskeleton that was specifically designed with spastic hand in mind. The exoskeleton features an adaptive cable-linkage transmission mechanism equipped with bi-directional force transducers, enabling constant-velocity extension and flexion of individual finger joints while simultaneously recording joint torque and angle. Based on the exoskeleton, a multi-layered quantitative assessment approach is proposed to evaluate spasticity on individual finger joints. The basis of the approach is collecting joint resistance information automatically following Modified Tardieu Scale, serving for the computation of six middle-level parameters related to the properties of a spastic joint. The parameters include the range of motion, average resistance torque, joint stiffness, joint viscosity, catch angle, and reflex-induced resistance torque. The first four mechanical parameters are finally combined into a biomechanical metric, whereas the rest two reflex-related parameters result in a neurological metric, to neatly describe spasticity level. The performance of the exoskeleton to measure the parameters was tested on six healthy subjects. The assessment approach applied with the developed exoskeleton shows good reliability, repeatability, and validity to capture the features of spastic hands, providing strong evidence for further validation on real patients."
An Improved Flexible Hand Exoskeleton with SEA for Finger Strength Estimation and Progressive Resistance Exercise,"Hand exoskeletons can recognize user's intent and provide active resistance training to enhance finger strength in stroke patients. However, achieving fine human-robot interaction (HRI) while maintaining system simplicity for lightweight design remains a key challenge. In this work, we present an improved flexible hand exoskeleton with series elastic actuator (SEA) for hand strength estimation and progressive resistance exercise. The SEA design allows the hand exoskeleton to have backdrivability to improve HRI performance. By combining the flexible linkage with the flex sensor, we propose a novel user interface that is able to sensitively acquire hand motion intent. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based tracking errors estimation is designed to evaluate the finger strength. The results of the finger strength estimation are used to adjust the parameters of the admittance model to provide small or large damping when the user's finger strength is low or high, achieving active admittance control based progressive resistance exercise. The feasibility has been demonstrated by two sets of experiments, and this work has established a hand exoskeleton solution for finger strength estimation and fine human-robot interaction."
A Variable Stiffness Supernumerary Robotic Limb with Pneumatic-Tendon Coupled Actuation,"Supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) can assist humans in achieving efficient and comfortable work in daily life or industrial assembly scenarios, requiring SRLs to switch between rigidity and flexibility to perform compliant movements while also providing stable support for humans to reduce fatigue from prolonged standing, existing SRLs struggle to achieve this transition. In this study, a variable stiffness supernumerary robotic limb (VSSRL) is implemented, capable of adjusting its position and stiffness through pneumatic-tendon coupled actuation. The position of the VSSRL is accurately modulated by tendons, while its stiffness is controlled by pneumatic-tendon coupled actuation, tendons significantly increase the overall stiffness of the VSSRL, and the fiber-reinforced actuators (FRAs) can dynamically adjust its stiffness in response to changes in dynamic loads. Furthermore, a kinematic model of the VSSRL and a stiffness model under the coupling of FRAs and tendons are developed. Then, the trajectory and stiffness of the VSSRL in task execution are assigned based on human motion, and a multi-objective control system for both position and stiffness of the VSSRL is designed based on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, achieving collaborative control of position and stiffness for the VSSRL. The accuracy of the control system is validated through experiments, which demonstrate that the load capacity of the VSSRL is significantly enhanced under the action of tendons and FRAs, and that the VSSRL is able to provide various modes of assistance for daily life activities."
Touch-Sensitive Hand Interactions for Social Robots Using Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors,"Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) has been demonstrated to be essential in the implementation of social assistive robots (SARs), which require advanced sensing capabilities for accurate and responsive engagement. This study presents the development and validation of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor network integrated into the hand of the CASTOR robot to classify complex pHRIs. Nine pHRIs were collected and evaluated within the high five, pets, handshakes, hits, and pinches categories. Four machine learning (ML) algorithms were tested, and the Bagged Decision Tree Classifier (BDTC) achieved the best performance. During testing, the model achieved an accuracy of 98%. The results demonstrate that the proposed FBG sensor network can classify complex pHRIs. Future work will explore additional instrumented areas of the robot and expand the physical interaction analysis to enhance social robot adaptability and user experience."

TacCap: A Wearable FBG-Based Tactile Sensor for Seamless Human-To-Robot Skill Transfer,"Tactile sensing is essential for dexterous manipulation, yet large-scale human demonstration datasets lack tactile feedback, limiting their effectiveness in skill transfer to robots. To address this, we introduce TacCap, a wearable Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based tactile sensor designed for seamless human-to-robot transfer. TacCap is lightweight, durable, and immune to electromagnetic interference, making it ideal for real-world data collection. We detail its design and fabrication, evaluate its sensitivity, repeatability, and cross-sensor consistency, and assess its effectiveness through grasp stability prediction and ablation studies. Our results demonstrate that TacCap enables transferable tactile data collection, bridging the gap between human demonstrations and robotic execution. To support further research and development, we open-source our hardware design and software."
UniTac-NV: A Unified Tactile Representation for Non-Vision-Based Tactile Sensors,"Generalizable algorithms for tactile sensing remain underexplored, primarily due to the diversity of sensor modalities. Recently, many methods for cross-sensor transfer between optical (vision-based) tactile sensors have been investigated, yet little work focus on non-optical tactile sensors. To address this gap, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture to unify tactile data across non-vision-based sensors. By leveraging sensor-specific encoders, the framework creates a latent space that is sensor-agnostic, enabling cross-sensor data transfer with low errors and direct use in downstream applications. We leverage this network to unify tactile data from two commercial tactile sensors: the Xela uSkin uSPa 46 and the Contactile PapillArray. Both were mounted on a UR5e robotic arm, performing force-controlled pressing sequences against distinct object shapes (circular, square, and hexagonal prisms) and two materials (rigid PLA and flexible TPU). Another more complex unseen object was also included to investigate the model's generalization capabilities. We show that alignment in latent space can be implicitly learned from joint autoencoder training with matching contacts collected via different sensors. We further demonstrate the practical utility of our approach through contact geometry estimation, where downstream models trained on one sensor's latent representation can be directly applied to another without retraining."
"High Resolution, Large Area Vision-Based Tactile Sensing Based on a Novel Piezoluminescent Skin","The ability to precisely perceive external physical interactions would enable robots to interact effectively with the environment and humans. While vision-based tactile sensing has improved robotic grippers, it is challenging to realize high resolution vision-based tactile sensing in robot arms due to presence of curved surfaces, difficulty in uniform illumination, and large distance of sensing area from the cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel piezoluminescent skin that transduces external applied pressures into changes in light intensity on the other side for viewing by a camera for pressure estimation. By engineering elastomer layers with specific optical properties and integrating a flexible electroluminescent panel as a light source, we develop a compact tactile sensing layer that resolves the layout issues in curved surfaces. We achieved multipoint pressure estimation over an expansive area of 502 sq. cm with high spatial resolution, a Two-Point Discrimination distance of 3 mm horizontally and 5 mm vertically which is comparable to that of human fingers as well as a high localization accuracy (RMSE of 1.92 mm). These promising attributes make this tactile sensing technique suitable for use in robot arms and other applications requiring high resolution tactile information over a large area."
Compact LED-Based Displacement Sensing for Robot Fingers,"In this paper, we introduce a sensor designed for integration in robot fingers, where it can provide information on the displacements induced by external contact. Our sensor uses LEDs to sense the displacement between two plates connected by a transparent elastomer; when a force is applied to the finger, the elastomer displaces and the LED signals change. We show that using LEDs as both light emitters an receivers in this context provides high sensitivity, allowing such an emitter and receiver pairs to detect very small displacements. We characterize the standalone performance of the sensor by testing the ability of a supervised learning model to predict complete force and torque data from its raw signals, and obtain a mean error between 0.05 and 0.07 N across the three directions of force applied to the finger. Our method allows for finger-size packaging with no amplification electronics, low cost manufacturing, easy integration into a complete hand, and high overload shear forces and bending torques, suggesting future applicability to complete manipulation tasks."
A Variable-Stiffness Neck Exoskeleton with Pneumatic-Driven Actuators for Prolonged Head Flexion Assistance,"Surgeons are frequently subjected to prolonged unnatural postures, such as sustained neck flexion during surgical procedures, increasing their susceptibility to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Despite the prevalence of such issues, there remains a scarcity of ergonomic solutions that effectively mitigate neck pain while permitting full operational functionality across diverse environments. In this paper, we present a novel variable-stiffness neck exoskeleton with pneumatic-driven tensile actuators for prolonged head flexion assistance. Its innovative design facilitates unrestricted head movement while providing expected neck support, thereby minimizing strain on antagonist muscle groups. Comprehensive experimental evaluations were conducted to assess the systemâ€™s performance. Transitional response times between flexible and rigid states were 0.28 s and 0.46 s, respectively. Experimental trials involving five healthy subjects demonstrated that the average muscular activity reduction of the splenius capitis and the sternocleidomastoid muscles were 38.8Â±2.0% and 9.7Â±2.5%, respectively. These experimental results demonstrated great potential of the exoskeleton in practical application for alleviating the physical burden during prolonged head flexion."
Design and Control of Soft Robotic Wearable with SMA-Based Artificial Muscle Fibers for Ankle Assistance,"Soft robotic wearables, with lightweight and flexible actuation, have shown promising results in assistive applications. However, it remains unclear whether they can be made fully comfortable and suitable for everyday use. In this study, we introduce a clothing-type soft robotic wearable embedded with shape memory alloy (SMA) based artificial muscle fibers for ankle plantarflexion assistance. We conducted force characterization of SMA wires, analyzing the effects of thickness, strain, applied current, and number of wires. The actuator was designed to achieve assistive force of 80 N and implemented a closed-loop controller with a PI controller to enable precise force and displacement control. Last, we demonstrate that the developed system can deliver controlled and repeatable forces in bench tests and modulate peak force according to target assistive levels on the ankle during walking in a user study."
Exo-ViHa: A Cross-Platform Exoskeleton System with Visual and Haptic Feedback for Efficient Dexterous Skill Learning,"Imitation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robot skills learning. However, traditional data collection systems for dexterous manipulation face challenges, including a lack of balance between acquisition efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce Exo-ViHa, an innovative 3D-printed exoskeleton system that enables users to collect data from a first-person perspective while providing real-time haptic feedback. This system combines a 3D-printed modular structure with a slam camera, a motion capture glove, and a wrist-mounted camera. Various dexterous hands can be installed at the end, enabling it to simultaneously collect the posture of the end effector, hand movements, and visual data. By leveraging the first-person perspective and direct interaction, the exoskeleton enhances the task realism and haptic feedback, improving the consistency between demonstrations and actual robot deployments. In addition, it has cross-platform compatibility with various robotic arms and dexterous hands. Experiments show that the system can significantly improve the success rate and efficiency of data collection for dexterous manipulation tasks."
A Two-Stage Dynamic Parameters Identification Approach Based on Kalman Filter for Haptic Rendering in Telerobotics,"In teleoperated physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI), accurate contact force feedback is essential for operators to experience intuitive and responsive interaction. However, the presence of end-effectors on the manipulator often interferes with the force feedback, misrepresenting the real contact forces. To render a precise force to operators, it is critical to eliminate the non-contact forces arising from the end-effector toolâ€™s inertia. To achieve this, the fast and accurate dynamic parameters identification for the end-effectors is essential. Currently, existing dynamic identification algorithms process all collected data in one stage, in which the sensor noises for static and dynamic parameters are coupled, resulting in poor performance. In this letter, we propose a two-stage method for end-effector's inertial parameters identification. Our proposed method breaks the identification process into two steps: the static and the dynamic processing stages, which can make full use of data features and significantly improve the accuracy of mass and Center-of-Mass (COM) identification. Additionally, we introduce the Kalman Filter (KF) into the linear fitting to improve the identification speed. Comparative and ablation experiments are designed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the RTLS method in reducing identification errors by 96% for mass and 81.2%â€“87.6% for COM. As for the haptic rendering, the errors are also reduced by 36.3% in direction of interaction and 99.5% in direction of gravity after the elimination of the end-effectorâ€™s inertia."
ViaTac: A High-Resolution Piezoresistive Tactile Sensor Array with Conformal Contact Surface for Shape Reconstruction,"Tactile sensing is crucial for robots to achieve human-like manipulation capabilities and safe interaction with the environment.

In this paper, we present a low-cost and easily fabricated piezoresistive tactile sensor array that utilizes flexible printed circuit (FPC) via as electrodes to achieve high spatial resolution (64/cm^2), while incorporating stretchable materials for surface encapsulation to enable conformal contact with objects. Unified material selection for both the sensing and encapsulation layers ensures robust performance. We characterized the sensing performance, mechanical durability, and uniformity of the sensor array and further demonstrated its practical applications in contact shape reconstruction."
Three-Axis Flat and Lightweight Force/Torque Sensor for Enhancing Kinesthetic Sensing Capability of Robotic Hand (I),"When using a robot hand to grip objects, visual information is frequently adopted to determine the external characteristics of objects. However, in reality, purely visual data are insufficient to grasp unspecified objects; somatosensory feedback, which includes tactile and kinesthetic feedbacks, is required to understand the diverse intrinsic properties of objects. We implement a three-axis force/torque (F/T) sensor to measure the interaction force at the joints of a robotic hand and determine the various intrinsic characteristics that aid in grasping previously unknown objects. We primarily focus on a modular, compact, and lightweight structure to embed the sensors in the robotic hand. A novel radially symmetric diaphragm flexure structure is designed to achieve this objective. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the F/T sensor. The functionality of the kinesthetic feedback is demonstrated using a stiffness and weight measurement experiment. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed sensor-embedded robotic hand can measure stiffness and weight with errors of 0.0073 N/mm and 8.72 g, respectively."
RoTipBot: Robotic Handling of Thin and Flexible Objects Using Rotatable Tactile Sensors,"This paper introduces RoTipBot, a novel robotic system for handling thin, flexible objects. Different from previous works that are limited to singulating them using suction cups or soft grippers, RoTipBot can count multiple layers and then grasp them simultaneously in a single grasp closure. Specifically, we first develop a vision-based tactile sensor named RoTip that can rotate and sense contact information around its tip. Equipped with two RoTip sensors, RoTipBot rolls and feeds multiple layers of thin, flexible objects into the centre between its fingers, enabling effective grasping. Moreover, we design a tactile-based grasping strategy that uses RoTipâ€™s sensing ability to ensure both fingers maintain secure contact with the object while accurately counting the number of fed objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the RoTip sensor and the RoTipBot approach. The results show that RoTipBot not only achieves a higher success rate but also grasps and counts multiple layers simultaneously â€“ capabilities not possible with previous methods. Furthermore, RoTipBot operates up to three times faster than state-of-the-art methods. The success of RoTipBot paves the way for future research in object manipulation using mobilised tactile sensors.

Consequently, the OBS sensor offers a straightforward and effective solution for enhancing tactile sensing in robotic grippers."
A Drivingâ€“Clamping Integrated Inchworm Linear Piezoelectric Actuator with Miniaturization and High Thrust Density (I),"This article presents an inchworm linear piezoelectric actuator (ILPA) to address the prevalent issues of bulk and complexity in existing ILPAs. It has the characteristics of miniaturization with a size of 44Ã—13Ã—24 mm^3 and a weight of 36.0 g. It integrates multiple functions within a compact form factor. The mechanical structure is simplified to a stator and an output shaft. The integrally machined stator is used as a guide unit without additional guideways and components. A key feature of the ILPA is its integrated driving mechanism that combines driving and clamping actions. This mechanism is designed as a bridge-type displacement amplifier, where the main displacement serves the driving function, while the parasitic displacement provides the clamping action. Experimental results show that the ILPA achieves a maximum speed of 1691.8 μm/s under the condition of square wave excitation with a frequency of 417 Hz and an input voltage of 120 V. Furthermore, it delivers a thrust of 1.5 N and a self-locking force of 2.1 N. Its force-to-volume ratio with a thrust density of 1.09Ã—10^-4 N/mm^3 stands out.

A Hybrid Variable-Stiffness Soft Back Support Device,"Back support devices (BSDs) have the potential to mitigate overexertion in industrial tasks and also to provide assistance to people with weak back muscle strength in daily activity. While state-of-the-art active BSDs can offer a high assistive force, they are bulky and heavy, making them uncomfortable for daily use. On the contrary, passive BSDs are compact but need manual adjustment to be versatile. This work presents a hybrid soft BSD that can provide task-oriented assistance by tuning the stiffness (0.58 N/mm, 0.92 N/mm, and 1.7 N/mm) and slack length (0 mm to 67 mm) in a compact design. The tunable stiffness allows for selecting a task-specific force profile, and the slack tuning will ensure that the device enables unhindered movement when assistance is not required. Compared with rigid devices, the device's compliance can potentially increase human comfort. We propose an analytical model that facilitates device design and estimates the device performance. Furthermore, the device's tuning capabilities are evaluated in human squatting and stooping experiments, showing that the desired force profile is correctly applied."

The flexible sensor can sensitively detect external stimuli, such as the touch of a 1g weight or a feather, and exhibits a good linear relationship with curvature, facilitating accurate curvature classification. Additionally, leveraging the wearable nature of the sensor, we achieved the detection of finger bending angles. Finally, by attaching the sensor to the wrist and combining it with deep learning algorithms, we achieved 100% gesture recognition accuracy.
